SNPUtilities is a Swift-based helper library for iOS. Our plan is to add any helper function or class in this repo. Current version contains file manager related tasks such as clear temp files. It also contains SNPError, a custom error maker we need in our application, Snapp. This SNPError is used in API callbacks or as input parameter type in a function.

## Getting Started

1.git clone https://github.com/snapp-cab/SNPUtilities.git<br/>
2.run pod install in the iOS project.<br />

```ruby
pod 'SNPUtilities'
```
